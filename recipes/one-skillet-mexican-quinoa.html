    <strong>One Skillet Mexican Quinoa</strong> - an easy one-pot meal that’s perfect for busy weeknights. Each serving has 20 grams of protein! (vegan + gluten-free)

<p>
    Do you remember when quinoa was just becoming a thing and everyone walked around calling it kwinoah?  
</p>
<p>
    Sigh…those were the good ‘ol days.
</p>
    Quinoa was actually one of the first things I learned to cook when I realized that eating frozen pizza and faux chicken nuggets probably wasn’t the best way to approach a vegetarian diet. I was blown away that this tiny little grain (technically seed) could provide so many important nutrients like iron, fiber, magnesium, B-vitamins, AND all of the essential amino acids. From there I subconsciously made a goal to eat it at least once a week.
<p>
    Of course that didn’t sustain itself once I started the blog. I’m sure most of you wouldn’t mind seeing quinoa that frequently but I put pressure on myself to mix things up in hopes that it doesn’t get too boring around here.
</p>
<p>
    Mexican food is an exception. Obviously.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of which, we’re just a few weeks from Cinco de Mayo so if you have plans to stay-in and want to make something healthy-ish, this One Skillet Mexican Quinoa would be puurrfect! Because Cinco de Mayo is on a Thursday and I don’t know about you but I’m not about to get fancy on a weeknight and make enchiladas.
</p>
<p>
    So this meal comes together in a flash thanks to canned beans and tomato sauce (all BPA-free, of course). You cook the veggies with the spices on the stove then pour everything in, cover with a lid and let it boil for 30 minutes. That’s all there is to it! 
</p>
<p>
    I like to serve it with a big dollop of homemade guacamole, fresh cilantro and crispy tortilla chips. Then I alternate between eating it from the fork and a chip as I go. That’s my way of eating chips in moderation.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 medium jalapeño pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup yellow corn</li>
    <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 medium avocado - peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
    <li>1 medium lime, juiced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
       <li>In a large skillet warm 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, until translucent. Add the bell pepper, garlic, 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon oregano then stir everything together and cook for about 5 more minutes.</li>
       <p></p>
       <li>Next add the drained and rinsed beans, rinsed quinoa, tomato sauce, and 1 and 1/3 cup water. Stir together then turn the heat to medium high and bring to a low boil. Cover with a lid and allow to cook for about 30 minutes, stirring intermittently. When its finished the quinoa will be soft and most of the liquid will have absorbed.</li>
       <p></p>
       <li>Meanwhile make the guacamole by mashing all of the ingredients together in a small bowl. Serve the quinoa warm with guacamole, fresh cilantro and tortilla chips. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.</li>
